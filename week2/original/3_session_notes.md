# Unsupervised Learning - Clustering

### Overview of this Lecture:
- Clustering Methods
- Community detection in networks

## Clustering Methods
Say you have a dataset, how do you determine how many Principle Components do you keep? 

Typically 70-80% of explained variance (GPT when reviewing said 90-95%, double check this number)
This is where the elbow method typically comes into play as well. 

Another thing to use to determine, is to evaluate the correlation matrix for variables that have a correlation greater then 1.
This is equivalent to keeping all principle components that have more variability then you would expect by chance.

What is required for a clustering method? We need to be able to break up the space.

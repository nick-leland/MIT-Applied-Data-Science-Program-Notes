# Notes from Guided Example

When using a '_classification_report_' : 

**Precision** is the accuracy of **positive** predictoins.  Of how many were predicted positive, how many were actually positive? 
**Recall**: Is the ability for the model to identify all relative instances. 

**High Precision, Low Recall** : Very selective with positives but fewer false positives mean man ymissing true positives. 
**High Recall, Low Precision** means that we have most true positives but we are also including many false positives.
